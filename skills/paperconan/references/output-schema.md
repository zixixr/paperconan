# paperconan output schema (scan.json)

Full structure of the `scan.json` the agent parses. The SKILL.md keeps only the
essentials; this file is the complete reference (it travels in the skill bundle).

`paper` provenance is populated from a `paperconan_source.json` sidecar that
`paperconan fetch --download/--auto` writes alongside the data, or from
`paperconan <dir> --doi <DOI> --title <T>`. It is `null` when neither is present
(a bare directory audit) — never read `null` as "no paper".

## Every finding has

- `kind`: detector name (see [detectors.md](detectors.md))
- `severity`: `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`
- `rule`: human-readable rule string e.g. `col[27] ≡ col[28] in 9/10 rows`
- `n`: sample size for the rule
- `evidence`: block snippet `{headers, rows, highlight_cols, ...}` — used by report.html, but you can also surface a few highlighted values if useful
- `likely_benign` (optional): a common innocent explanation for this kind — surface it to the user alongside the finding so a signal is never reported as a verdict
- `profile_action`: `"kept"` | `"demoted"` | `"hidden"` — what the active profile did to this finding. `"demoted"`/`"hidden"` means the current `severity` is the **filter's** downgrade, not the detector's raw verdict (always `"kept"` under `--profile forensic`). See the Profiles section in SKILL.md.
- `false_positive_context` (list): machine tags for *why* it was demoted — e.g. `axis_or_scan_column`, `censoring_or_boundary_value`, `derived_or_unit_conversion`, `same_data_replot_or_duplicate_upload`, `omics_or_large_matrix_boundary_flood`. Map these back to the "常见误报" notes in [detectors.md](detectors.md).
- `prefilter_reason` (optional): deterministic triage explanation, especially for within-column findings. Treat it as a structured clue, not a final answer. It can explain why a pattern was kept, demoted, or considered a likely structural false positive.
- `prefilter_flags` (optional object): deterministic flags supporting the prefilter decision, such as axis/index-like labels, percentage/ratio/normalized/model-output context, low cardinality, boundary/floor/ceiling values, fixed-denominator hints, or repeated fill values. Use these with [judgment-rubric.md](judgment-rubric.md) before surfacing prefiltered hits.
- `dense_block` (optional, column-relation / equal-pair findings): `true` means this finding comes from a sheet that floods with pairwise column relations (a dense / correlated matrix — correlation tables, normalized replicate panels). Such findings are auto-demoted to `low` severity because identical/linear columns there are expected by construction, not a duplication red flag — don't treat them as high-severity signal
- `value_sample` (optional, within-column findings): small sample of distinct values from the column. Use it for repeated-value explanation, last-two-decimal checks, and fixed-denominator triage.
- `col_a_sample` / `col_b_sample` (optional, pairwise relation findings): small value samples from the relevant column(s), used as an evidence peek when the full table is large. These samples help explain cross-column transforms and relation prefilters, but they do not replace opening the original table when making a serious claim.

## cross_sheet_findings fields

- `same_file`: whether the two sheets live in one workbook or span two files
- `figure_a` / `figure_b` / `same_figure`: parsed figure identity (e.g. `main:5`, `ext:6`). When `same_figure` is true the overlap is a combined-vs-individual re-plot of one display item — it is **downgraded to `low`** and carries a `context` note. Cross-figure / cross-file overlaps keep `high`/`medium` and are the ones worth checking against the legend.
- `delta`: how the two near-duplicate tables differ — `{pattern, modified_cells, shared_values, only_in_a, only_in_b}`. `pattern` is one of:
  - `perfect_dup` — identical value multiset (clean re-plot)
  - `superset` — one side strictly contains the other (e.g. an extra replicate column, n=5 vs n=6)
  - `value_tweaked` — cells changed in place (copy-then-tweak fingerprint; most worth investigating)
  - `value_divergent` — both sides hold values the other lacks
